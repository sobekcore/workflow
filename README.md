# Workflow
Application that helps to create processes adjusted to your business. Represent complex workflows in a non-complex way that makes sense.

The application is currently in trial-only mode. Access duration is permanent, but is subject to change. Data persistence and system stability are not guaranteed, until the full version is released.

## Privacy
This project does not collect any data about users. The single piece of information that is being saved into the database is user's email address, however that is only used to confirm real identity of the user.

## Testing
Every piece of business logic is thoughtfully tested before each release. The project aims to have **90%+ test coverage** across both API and client-side applications.
